# Streampanel

StreamDeck alternative for phones (Desktop part).

Project is still kinda slightly implemented but there's place for some "done/todo"s:

- [x] Basic GUI
- [x] iPhone USB connection (not stable)
- [x] "Actions" drag'n'drop
- [x] Folders for nested panels
- [ ] iPhone panel sync (with button images)
- [ ] Wi-Fi connection
- [ ] Better class structure for "Actions"
- [ ] OBS Actions
